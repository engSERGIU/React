        The application measures your <b>reaction time</b>.
        Simple reaction time is the motion required for an observer to respond to the presence of a stimulus.
        Mean RT for college-age individuals is about 160 milliseconds to detect an auditory stimulus,
            and approximately 190 milliseconds to detect visual stimulus.
        The mean reaction times for sprinters at the Beijing Olympics were 166 ms for males and 189 ms for females,
            but in one out of 1,000 starts they can achieve 109 ms and 121 ms, respectively.
